# Fawry Book Store Challenge

## Dependencies Used
- **Lombok:** Used to reduce code by automatically generating getters, setters, constructors, and other common methods through annotations. This keeps the code clean and concise, especially for attributes that do not require custom validation.
- **JUnit:** Used as the testing framework for writing and running unit tests.
